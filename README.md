# /root access - Global Game Jam 2023 - Guildford

It’s 21XX. The outside world is largely uninhabitable. Most in-person interaction has been replaced by an interconnected VR network that interacts with neural implants through a headset, all designed and sold by Mianaai Corp. Plants, seasons, William Gibson novels, all now half-remembered remnants of the old world. This was supposed to be fun…

You are a specialist. Until yesterday, you designed realistic tree assets for Mianaai Corp to place in their prohibitively expensive virtual parks. Your trees don’t just look like trees, they feel like trees. But nowadays, the average person has no memory of what a tree felt like. The entropy of cultural memory is making you obsolete. From now on, you are freelance. You have to get creative.

You wake up to the permanent half-light of a half-ended world. You are running out of meds. Your bed is broken, but your headset works just fine. You put it on and enter your modest virtual apartment. Time to make some money, by any means necessary.

You log on. You exit out of a rejection email. Colonel B. Root’s face appears in the bottom left corner of your screen.

Colonel Root: ‘I heard about your problem at work. Sounds like you’re pretty screwed. You need those meds to function, right? To be your ideal self… You’re never gonna make the money you need just making pretty trees. There’s a quicker way. Just do what I say, and we’ll both profit.

I’m gonna help you get to the top of the food chain, starting with the bottom feeders. Remember, if you don’t make a certain amount of money, your headset will be cut off along with your livelihood. Same deal if you get caught. Then it’s no meds, no trees, no nothing. Let’s get to it.

Some people are low threat, which means they’re unlikely to detect a hack. If they do detect it, good luck meeting their powerful friends.

Some people are wealthy, some aren’t. That’s life. Hack a rich guy and you might be able to spare the next few rubes. Let’s get paid.
